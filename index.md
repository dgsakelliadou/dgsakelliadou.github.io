## About Me

I am a computational neuroscientist interested in the intersection of (Working) Memory, network neuroscience and dynamical systems. My aim is to advance our understanding regarding the computational principles governing memory in both natural and artificial systems. 


I'm currently a postdoc at MIT Picower Institute for Learning & Memory, advised by Earl K. Miller.
My research focuses on multivariate methods for interareal communication as well as optimal control for biophysically plausible neural networks. 



## Research Interests

- Multivariate models for Communication Subspaces/Latent Communication
- Dynamical Systems
- Optimal Control for Continuous Attractor Networks
- Traveling waves
